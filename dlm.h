/*
 * Flags to dlm_lock
 *
 * DLM_LKF_NOQUEUE
 *
 * Do not queue the lock request on the wait queue if it cannot be granted
 * immediately.  If the lock cannot be granted because of this flag, DLM will
 * either return -EAGAIN from the dlm_lock call or will return 0 from
 * dlm_lock and -EAGAIN in the lock status block when the AST is executed.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_CONVERT
 *
 * Indicates a lock conversion request.  For conversions the name and namelen
 * are ignored and the lock ID in the LKSB is used to identify the lock.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_VALBLK
 *
 * Requests DLM to return the current contents of the lock value block in the
 * lock status block.  When this flag is set in a lock conversion from PW or EX
 * modes, DLM assigns the value specified in the lock status block to the lock
 * value block of the lock resource.  The LVB is a DLM_LVB_LEN size array
 * containing application-specific information.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_QUECVT
 *
 * Force a conversion lock request to the back of the convert queue.  All other
 * conversion requests ahead of it must be granted before it can be granted.
 * This enforces a FIFO ordering on the convert queue.  When this flag is set,
 * indefinite postponement is averted.  This flag is allowed only when
 * converting a lock to a more restrictive mode.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_CANCEL
 *
 * Used to cancel a pending conversion (with dlm_unlock).  Lock is returned to
 * previously granted mode.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_IVVALBLK
 *
 * Invalidate/clear the lock value block.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_CONVDEADLK
 *
 * The granted mode of a lock being converted (from a non-NL mode) can be
 * changed to NL in the process of acquiring the requested mode to avoid
 * conversion deadlock.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_PERSISTENT
 *
 * Only relevant to locks originating in userspace. Signals to the ioctl.c code
 * that this lock should not be unlocked when the process exits.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_NODLKWT
 *
 * This lock is not to be checked for conversion deadlocks.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_NODLCKBLK
 *
 * not yet implemented
 *
 * DLM_LKF_EXPEDITE
 *
 * If this lock conversion cannot be granted immediately it is to go to the
 * head of the conversion queue regardless of its requested lock mode.
 *
 * DLM_LKF_NOQUEUEBAST
 *
 * Send blocking AST's before returning -EAGAIN to the caller.  It is only
 * used along with the NOQUEUE flag.  Blocking AST's are not sent for failed
 * NOQUEUE requests otherwise.
